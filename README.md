# [userblock](https://mchangrh.github.io/bd-plugin/userblock.plugin.js)
userblock is a heavily modified version of [ChatFilter](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ChatFilter) by [mwittrien](https://github.com/mwittrien)

This version does not censor text but instead blocks messages from users - this can block users communicating over a bridge or annoying webhook spam. 

Usernames can be added and removed manually and there are two block types available - replace text and "discord block". Discord block will group blocked messages together similar to blocked Discord messages but takes a while to update. A combination of the two is recommended.

This plugin for BetterDiscord still requires mwritten's 0BDFDB plugin to function.

This can also be used in conjunction with [RemoveBlockedUsers](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/RemoveBlockedUsers) to completely remove the "1 blocked message" prompts.

# [NoYubikeyOTP](https://mchangrh.github.io/bd-plugin/NoYubikeyOTP.plugin.js)

Don't send yubikey OTPs in chat

Stops sending message and clears it if the contents only contain OTP, stops sending if there are other contents.

# [blockbotreply](https://mchangrh.github.io/bd-plugin/blockbotreply.plugin.js)

Blocks bot replies to blocked users

This is very useful for DeArrow bot or any other bots that constantly and automatically reply to users.
